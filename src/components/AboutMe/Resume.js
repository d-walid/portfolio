            During the past I studied human resources and administration. I also
            worked as a bookseller in a library, inventory counter for RGIS and
            client advisor for ENGIE.
          </p>
          <p>
            I stayed some years in an association of ~80 members who organize a
            convention each year. In this association, I did a lot of different
            tasks like communication, human resources, administration. I worked
            with some companies who had talents and public figures and worked as
            the middle man.
          </p>
          <p>
            Actually, I’m still in an association but mine. It’s called
            “Découvrir Nancy”. It’s a website and the goal is to promote my city
            with some posts, interviews from local companies, associations or
            different places, museums etc…Proud of the job that my team and I
            did during the last two years.
