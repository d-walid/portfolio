            Last but not least, hobbies and passions. Let’s start with my
            hobbies. I started playing the piano some months ago beign it one of
            my favourite instruments (along with guitar and violin). I also like
            to draw when I have some spare time.

            Reading books, mangas (PS: I’m a weeb) is something I do ever since
            I was 9 years old. I also enjoy playing video games and I'm
            currently learning Japanese.

            I spoke a little bit about music. I can't live without it. I listen
            to lot of songs every day, be it pop, rock, blues, country,
            classical etc. I also watch a lot of movies. And I’m a huge Japan
            lover. My dream is to someday travel there. I love their culture,
            history, traditions. The list goes on and on so I will stop right
            there haha.
